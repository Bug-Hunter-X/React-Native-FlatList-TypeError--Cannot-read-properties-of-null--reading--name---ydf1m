This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and trying to render items that have a null or undefined value for a particular property.  For example, if your data array contains objects like this and you are trying to render `item.name`:

```javascript
const data = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Item 1' },
  { id: 2, name: null },
  { id: 3, name: 'Item 3' },
];
```

React Native might throw a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'name')` or similar error because it tries to access the `name` property of an object where the `name` property is null or undefined.
